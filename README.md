# UniDL4BioPep_ASL_PyTorch

Welcome to UniDL4BioPep_PyTorch<br>
Here, you will see a simple piece of code applies the methodology proposed in the research paper **UniDL4BioPep: A universal deep learning architecture for binary classification in peptide bioactivity** with the [ASloss function](https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ASL) aiming for better performances on imbalanced datasets.

You may be curious about our main [Github repository](https://github.com/dzjxzyd/UniDL4BioPep), in which you will see more playable datasets and experimental details.

To play with this piece of code, simply, '''cd''' to the working directory;
'''
conda env create -f environment.yml
'''
And you will have all the requirements set.
